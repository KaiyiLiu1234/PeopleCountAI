# PeopleCountAI
 Given the rising cases in Covid-19 and the unprecedented need to improve our readiness for a future pandemic, People Count AI was created to help businesses or public spaces manage the number of people coming in and out. People Count AI keeps track in real time the number of people in your business and publishes this number onto a public website for customers to see. The goal is to help manage social distancing by giving the customers the information they need to keep safe. People Count AI will also provide services powered with Machine Learning to automatically count the number of people in your business, detect unsafe actions that violate quarantine or safety rules, and checks how long a single customer was in the store for. Currently, People Count AI is nearing completion of the website and will soon be able to go live in the next few days. Our future short time goals (to be completed in two weeks time) are to implement all of the Machine Learning programs.
